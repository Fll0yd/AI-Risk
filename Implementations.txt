please correct my code as per the official rules of the game.

is this code correct and complete as per the official rules of the game RISK? is not please provide corrected code.


The provided code seems to be a good attempt at implementing the game of Risk, but it does not fully adhere to the official rules of the game. Here are some issues and their corresponding fixes:

1. The `generate_cards` method generates a card for each territory and each type ('Infantry', 'Cavalry', 'Artillery'). However, according to the official rules, each territory should have only one card, and the type should be distributed evenly among the territories.

2. The `trade_cards_for_troops` method does not correctly implement the card trade-in rules. According to the official rules, players can trade in a set of three cards with the same type, or a set of three cards with one of each type. The number of troops received depends on the number of sets traded in so far in the game, not on the number of sets the player has traded in.

3. The `reinforce_territories` method does not allow the player to choose where to place their troops. According to the official rules, players can choose to place their troops on any territory they own.

4. The `attack` method does not correctly implement the battle rules. According to the official rules, the attacker can roll up to three dice (if they have at least four troops), and the defender can roll up to two dice. The dice are compared from highest to lowest, and for each pair, if the attacker's die is higher, the defender loses one troop, otherwise the attacker loses one troop.

5. The `fortify` method does not allow the player to choose how many troops to move. According to the official rules, players can move as many troops as they want from one territory to another, as long as they leave at least one troop behind.

6. The `start_game` method does not correctly implement the turn order. According to the official rules, players take turns in a clockwise order, not in the order they are listed in the `players` dictionary.

7. The `ai_turn` method does not correctly implement the AI's turn. The AI should make decisions based on the state of the game, not randomly.

8. The `check_win_condition` method does not correctly implement the win condition. According to the official rules, a player wins when they control all territories, not when they are the only player left with territories.

9. The `RiskGame` class does not implement the setup phase of the game, where players take turns placing their initial troops on the territories they own.
